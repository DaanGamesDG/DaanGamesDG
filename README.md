### 👋🏾 Hi there, It’s me Dave, also known as Daan. Here is some quick info about me.
## I like to program discord bots, and I'm planning on developing my own website, here is some more info about me!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my own public Discord bot
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and some HTML + CSS
- 📫 How to reach me: check my socials down below
- ⚡ Fun fact: The quarantine was effective, without it I never had any time to learn javascript
